You're doing great, and it’s completely okay to feel unsure at the start. Let's break down each of the tasks in your checklist and I’ll also give you **simple questions** you can ask your **manager and teammates** so you can confidently complete everything.

---

### ✅ **Task 1: Set up a 1:1 with your manager**

**Goal:** Understand your role, goals, and how success is measured.

**What to say/ask your manager in the meeting:**

* "Can you please explain my main responsibilities as a Frontend Developer Trainee?"
* "What are the success metrics or expectations for me in the next few months?"
* "Can we define some SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)?"
* "How will my performance be reviewed?"

📌 **Mark 'Yes' once you have the meeting.**
🕒 Fill the duration of the meeting (e.g., 00:30:00 if it was 30 mins).

---

### ✅ **Task 2: Schedule intro calls with team members**

**Goal:** Get to know your teammates.

**What to ask them:**

* "Hi, I’m new to the team and just joined as a frontend trainee. Could you tell me what your role is?"
* "How do you usually work with frontend developers?"
* "What tools or technologies do you commonly use?"
* "Do you have any tips for a new trainee like me?"

📌 Schedule 10–15 minute chats via Teams/Outlook and note down names.

---

### ✅ **Task 3: Knowledge transfer from manager or team member**

**Goal:** Learn how things work in your team.

**Ask your manager or senior developer:**

* "Can you show me where the codebase is hosted (GitHub, GitLab)?"
* "Is there a document that explains the project setup?"
* "Which tools do we use for frontend development and code reviews?"
* "How should I run the project locally?"

📌 Try to note everything they say in a notebook or Notion/Google Doc.

---

### ✅ **Task 4: Understand current project, client & deliverables**

**Goal:** Learn the project through KT (Knowledge Transfer), orientation sessions, or documents.

**Ask:**

* "Where can I find KT (Knowledge Transfer) documents or recordings?"
* "Is there a place like a Wiki or Confluence where all project details are written?"
* "Can I access the Learning Lab modules?"

📌 Mark it done once you’ve reviewed the material and got a basic understanding.

---

### ✅ **Task 5: Connect with 3–4 colleagues from other teams**

**Goal:** Learn about collaboration and communication.

**Ask teammates from different departments (backend, QA, devops):**

* "Can you tell me about what you do in your team?"
* "How do you usually work with the frontend team?"
* "Any suggestions for smooth communication across teams?"

📌 Note down who you spoke with and your learnings.

---

### ✅ **Task 6: Discuss Annual Goals with Manager**

**Goal:** After 90 days, update your goals again.

Since you're new, you don’t have to do this **right now**. You can just mention during your Task 1 discussion:

> “I’ll also be ready to revisit or update my goals after 90 days as mentioned.”

---

### ✍️ Extra Notes:

* Try to keep a **document** with names, dates, and short notes from each meeting.
* If unsure, you can send messages like:

  > "Hi, I’m a new frontend trainee and I have a 45-day checklist. Can we connect for 10–15 minutes for a quick intro?"
